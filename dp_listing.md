## Dynamic Programming Patterns
Welcome to the Dynamic Programming Patterns repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of interview problems categorized by key dynamic programming patterns. Each pattern includes a variety of problems sourced from top educational platforms such as Educative, GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode, and others. The categories include patterns like 0/1 Knapsack, Unbounded Knapsack, Recursive Numbers, Longest Common Substring, and Palindromic Subsequence. This collection aims to provide a deep understanding and practical solutions to some of the most common and challenging dynamic programming problems you'll encounter in technical interviews. Happy coding and good luck with your preparation!

###  1. 0/1 Knapsack

This pattern involves making decisions to include or exclude each item to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit. It's usually used in resource allocation problems where each item can either be taken or not (binary choice).
